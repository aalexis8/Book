This is a weird workflow. The class is weird for introducing git at this juncture. Although I needed a break from the challenges lol 
explaining the staging area, I am taking notes, but I used the staging area to parse my commits however I want. 
hence this commit. I was trying to show them to start with git, but they were focused on whatever. They were focused on code, creating it but not really understanding it. 
Not understanding how to use code. They just believed in code itself not as a tool. But it is a tool for software development, one of many. And it is dangerous to pretend that the only thing that matters is what the coder brings to the table. You are missing a ton of infrastructure and you demand the same result as those who do take the time to create the kind of environment necessary.
